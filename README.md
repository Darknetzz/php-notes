# php-notes-json

php-notes-json was the first version of php-notes.

All notes are stored in a simple JSON file.
I would recommend using php-notes-simple instead (using markdown files).

This branch is now read-only.

An *actual* super simple note page with markdown support!

Just git clone to your (PHP-supported) webserver and start taking notes. :)

```
cd /var/www/html
git clone https://github.com/Darknetzz/php-notes-simple.git notes
```

Then simply open the page in your browser and start taking notes.
https://<YOUR_SERVER>/notes
